# This GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automatically mark issues and pull requests as stale
# if they have had no activity for a specified amount of time. It uses the `actions/stale` action
# to perform this task. The workflow is scheduled to run daily at 07:38 AM (UTC) as specified by
# the cron expression.
#
# The workflow has the following permissions:
# - Read access to repository contents.
# - Write access to issues and pull requests.
#
# The workflow consists of a single job named `stale` that runs on the latest Ubuntu runner.
# The job includes the following steps:
# 1. Harden Runner: Uses the `step-security/harden-runner` action to enhance the security of the
#    runner by auditing egress traffic.
# 2. Mark Stale Issues and PRs: Uses the `actions/stale` action to mark issues and pull requests
#    as stale. The action is configured with the following parameters:
#    - `repo-token`: The GitHub token used to authenticate the action.
#    - `stale-issue-message`: The message to post on stale issues.
#    - `stale-pr-message`: The message to post on stale pull requests.
#    - `stale-issue-label`: The label to apply to stale issues.
#    - `stale-pr-label`: The label to apply to stale pull requests.
#
